# Simple python neural network
This is an example of a tensorflow AI neural network in action.
The neural network outputs (x,y) coordinates, which determine the position of the white square in the pygame display.
The goal of the white sprite is to reach the red target as efficiently as possible. 
When the white sprite reaches the red target, the position of the target is reset randomly. 
How the white sprite reaches the target is entirely up to the neural network.

(Correctly setting up the tensorflow module can be challenging as compatibility issues are common)
